# Workspace for projects/ideas involving statistics 

### This repository is dedicated to exploring and practicing statistical methods using python. Further work was performed with Mathematica. Concepts explored: Central Limit Theorem, Distribution Curves (Binomial, Guassian, &Poisson), Monte Carlo Method, Chi Square, and Maximum Likelihood. 

### Projects:
	* CLT_random_number_generator: exploring the central limit theorem 
	* distribution_curves: displaying data using best-fit distribution curves (Binomial, Gaussian, & Poisson)
	* monte-carlo-method: exploring the Monte Carlo Method with rejection hypotheses
	* chi-square: practice with the chi square test (still in progress). 
	* likelihood: calculating and plotting with the maximum likelihood method
	* equation_practice: practice with plots, equations, deriving equations in statistics using python (independent and supplemental workspace).
