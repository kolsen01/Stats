# The Monte Carlo Method

### About: 
#### Exploring the Monte Carlo Method with rejection method for frequency, the value of pi, and the ratio of a cube in a sphere. 

### rejection_frequency
#### Displaying the frequency, following x^2 - x^3, of random numbers on a histogram.

### rejection_pi_val
#### Using a random number generator, calculating the value of pi up to 12 decimal places.

### rejection_sphere_ratio
#### Calculates the ratio of the volume of an N-sphere inscribed into a unit N-cube.

### NOTE: 
#### Some projects are still a work in projects or have been completely independently in Mathematica.
